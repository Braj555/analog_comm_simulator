# AM & FM Signal Transmission and Reception Simulator

This project demonstrates the working of **Amplitude Modulation (AM)** and
**Frequency Modulation (FM)** using Python.

## Objective
To simulate AM and FM signal transmission and reception and visualize the
effect of noise in communication systems.

## Features
- Signal generation
- AM modulation and demodulation
- FM modulation and demodulation
- Noise analysis
- Interactive plots using Streamlit
- Export plots as PDF

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- ReportLab

## How to Run
```bash
pip install streamlit matplotlib numpy reportlab
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
